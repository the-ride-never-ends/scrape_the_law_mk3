# 1. Problem Definition

## 1.1 Problem Statement
Per the US Library of Congress, there currently does not exist a single repository for all US municipal codes.ยน This reduces government transparency, increases the cost of legal compliance, and prevents the automation of legal research.
- 1: See: https://guides.loc.gov/municipal-codes/current-municipal-codes, accessed 11/24/2024

## 1.2 Objective
Build a web scraping system to collect municipal legal codes from US cities/counties and store them in a structured database. The system will:
- Extract laws from official government or government-contracted websites and databases.
- Parse and standardize raw content into tabular data with metadata
- Store in a database with proper relationships and versioning
- Maintain version history and track code updates/amendments
- Handle different website structures and content formats
